Container images bundling applications written in specific programming languages can have requirements which only apply to that runtime environment. In this workshop we will look at various practices which can be applied when building container images for applications written in the Python programming language.

This workshop builds on some techniques covered in a previous workshop on building container images which apply good security principles. It is recommended that you do that workshop first if you have not done so.
